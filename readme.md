<h2>Introduction</h2>

The **WordPress Accelerated Mobile Pages Themes** plugin helps bloggers, publishers and other content creators to easily add AMP support to their WordPress websites. The **WP AMP Themes** plugin includes one FREE AMP theme (OBLIQ) which is customizable (colors, fonts, appearance) via the WordPress admin area.

The Accelerated Mobile Pages ("AMP") Project is an open source initiative that came out of discussions between publishers and technology companies about the need to improve the entire mobile content ecosystem for everyone — publishers, consumer platforms, creators, and users.

The OBLIQ AMP theme (available for FREE) comes with support for post details and includes a side menu with categories and pages.

Some of the AMP components that we've used when building OBLIQ:

* amp-accordion
* amp-img
* amp-sidebar
* amp-carousel
* amp-social-share

There are dozens of premium AMP themes available at AMPThemes.io: [BASE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/base-amp-theme/), [ELEVATE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/elevate-amp-theme/), [FOLIO](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/folio-amp-theme/), [INVISION](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/invision-amp-theme/), [POPSICLE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/popsicle-amp-theme/), [PULSE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/pulse-amp-theme/), [GHOST](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/ghost-amp-theme/), [PHANTOM](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/phantom-amp-theme/), [LUCID](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/lucid-amp-theme/), [EXTRUDE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/extrude-amp-theme/), [VEDI](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/vedi-amp-theme/), [BLEND](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/blend-amp-theme/), [PURE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/pure-amp-theme/), [GOTHAM](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/gotham-amp-theme/), [FUTURE](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/future-amp-theme/) & [PALM](https://ampthemes.io/downloads/palm-amp-theme/).

<h2>How Does AMP Work?</h2>

Essentially a framework for creating mobile web pages, AMP consists of three basic parts:

* AMP HTML: A subset of HTML, this markup language has some custom tags and properties and many restrictions. But if you are familiar with regular HTML, you should not have difficulty adapting existing pages to AMP HTML. For more details on how it differs from basic HTML, check out AMP Project’s list of required markup that your AMP HTML page “must” have.

* AMP JS: A JavaScript framework for mobile pages. For the most part, it manages resource handling and asynchronous loading. It should be noted that third-party JavaScript is not permitted with AMP.

* AMP CDN: An optional Content Delivery Network, it will take your AMP-enabled pages, cache them and automatically make some performance optimizations.

<h2>What Will AMP Look Like On Google?</h2>

Google has provided a demo of what an AMP feature would look like in the SERP. You can try it out by navigating to [g.co/ampdemo](http://g.co/ampdemo) on your mobile phone (or emulate it within Chrome Developer Tools). 
Then, search for something like: “Donald Trump”.

You will see a carousel toward the top with AMP articles. Click on one for a reading experience embedded in the SERP. You can swipe right or left to read another AMP-enabled article. It’s a different experience from simply navigating to a publisher’s AMP page.
